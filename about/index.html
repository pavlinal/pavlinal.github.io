<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

I am an international student at Mount Holyoke College, I come from the Czech Republic. At Mount Holyoke, I am junior double-majoring in Computer Science and International Relations.

In Computer Science, I am particularly interested in computer-human interaction, design and information retrieval, but I enjoy exploring other fields as well.

My focus in International Relations is "Peace and Security". I am particularly interested in International Law, diplomatic relations between states and security analysis of international conflicts. I am also very interested in exploring foreign cultures and learning new languages. I speak Czech and English fluently, but I am also learning French and Japanese.

In the future, I would like to combine what I have been learning in both of my majors and work in an IT departement of one of the major international companies.
